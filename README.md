# nessus-utilities

This repository contains Nessus tools I have created during my time as a security engineer.

1.  yane (Yet another Nessus Exporter) - Python script to export Nessus reports (CSV and .nessus formats)

    This program is meant to automate the process of exporting Nessus scans
    by accessing the Nessus server and programtically performing the actions
    a human user would take to perform the export function.
